  - I was writing this problem but all the keys on my keyboard were moved around. Help
hints:
  - This looks similar to the intended flag format, maybe the letters are just shifted?
  - Look into substitution ciphers that involve moving all the letters up and down by a certain key value
  - Is this a special case of the Caesar Cipher?
