  Despite the challenge's name, this has nothing to do with web cookies, but it's just a Cookie Clicker game.
  Just get 7,348,592,194,592,193 clicks to get the flag!
  Good luck using an auto clicker on this, the cookie moves ;)
hints:
  - Can you see a website's JavaScript?
  - Would looking at `script.js` help you?
  - How can you modify the value of a variable?
