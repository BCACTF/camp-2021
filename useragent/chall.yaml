  Welcome to the CAMPCTF flag storage vault. Members of the CAMPCTF organization
  can access flags by visiting the official website using the CAMPCTF browser, which
  is called 'ctfbrowser'. I'm not a member of the organization myself, but I just have 
  to get my hands on one of those flags. Could you help me out?
hints:
  - Can websites tell what browser you're using?
