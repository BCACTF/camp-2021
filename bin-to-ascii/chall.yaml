  Someone sent me this text file, and it's just a bunch of ones and zeros.
  To me it looks like they were just pressing random keys, I've never seen anything like it before.
  Wait actually on second thought, it reminds me of those hacker scenes in movies with the green zeros and ones on the black background.
  Can you be a master hackers from the movies and decrypt this message?
hints:
  - What is binary?
  - What is ASCII?
  - Are you able to convert one to the other?
