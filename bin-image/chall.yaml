  Someone gave me this image, but I don't know what it is. It's really long and is only black and white.
  Do you have any idea what it could be?
hints:
  - The image has only black or white pixels, which are **two** values. Is there anything else you know that stores information with **two** values?
  - It would take very long to do this by hand, could you write a script to do this automatically?
