  Okay, I admit Super Secure Password Program 2.0™ wasn't too good, but nothing will beat...
  Super Secure Password Program 3.0™
  This is the last one, because after getting sued since "I'm not allowed to put the trademark symbol wherever I like", I've run out of money and time to make a new one.
hints:
  - Can you run part of the code "in reverse"?
  - Can you convert the list of numbers back into letters?
