  I turned on my TV earlier today and it showed me a bunch of static. I noticed it kept showing something resembling a flag whenever two of these screens were about to switch and overlapped though. Could you try to get the flag out for me?
hints:
  - Look into visual cryptography
  - Maybe try laying the two provided images over eachother online?
  - Make sure to try out different transparencies!
