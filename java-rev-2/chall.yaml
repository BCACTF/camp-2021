  Okay, I've gotten several complaints that the Super Secure Password Program™ was not too Secure, so I decided to make a better version!
  Introducing Super Secure Password Program 2.0™
  This time the flag won't just be there, and no one will be able to find out what it is.
hints:
  - After modifying the input, we then check if it is equal to something.
  - Is it possible to run part of the code "in reverse"? Do the oppposite of the changes we did onto x on correctFlag.
